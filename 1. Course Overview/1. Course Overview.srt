00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Xin chào, tôi là Scott Allen

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
chào mừng các bạn đến với khóa học lập trình C#.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I've been using the C# language

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for over 15 years at this point

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
because I love working in C#, and I want to show you

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
all the great features of this language

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so that you will love it too.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the course we'll work

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
on building some simple applications

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and focusing on different areas of the language.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Like how to use classes,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
how to write methods and properties,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and how to raise and handle events.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll also give you some tips

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
on how to keep your code readable

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and tell about common conventions that you'll see

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in day-to-day programming with C#.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We'll also be looking at how to handle errors in your program.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And of course, I'll show you a few features

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of Visual Studio, too.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It will be fun for you to follow along.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
By the end of the course you'll feel comfortable

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
reading and writing C# code in your own applications.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I do expect that you have some programming experience

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
before you start this course.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ideally you feel comfortable with concepts

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
like loops and branching in programming.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll show you how to write loops and branches in C#,

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but the course will definitely be easier if you know

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
some of these fundamental programming concepts already.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And if not, there are plenty of courses on Pluralsight.com

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to help you get started programming as an absolute beginner.
